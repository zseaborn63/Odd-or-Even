# Odd-or-Even

This is a practice problem

# Problem

Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.

# Extras

1) If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.

2) Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.
